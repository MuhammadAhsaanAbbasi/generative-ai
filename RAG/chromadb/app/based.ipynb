      "1 Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners,  \n",
      "We are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity. As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic, social , \n",
      "and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity  \n",
      "for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our most pressing challenges.  \n",
      "This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty -eight years \n",
      "after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again —from PC/Server, to \n",
      "Web/Internet, to Cloud/Mob ile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once again, as \n",
      "we lead this new era.  \n",
      "Amid this transformation, our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve \n",
      "more  remains constant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology \n",
      "and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.  \n",
      "Here are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:  \n",
      "• Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the \n",
      "healthcare industry today —including physician burnout —by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on \n",
      "Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eX perience Copilot.  \n",
      "• Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50  percent with GitHub \n",
      "Copilot, as the company works to democratize e -commerce across Latin America.  \n",
      "• Mercedes -Benz is making its in -car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using \n",
      "ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service.  \n",
      "• Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value -\n",
      "added activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.  \n",
      "• Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI, and \n",
      "Azure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.  \n",
      "• And, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students \n",
      "learn English using Azure AI.  \n",
      "To build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud \n",
      "while innovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know that \n",
      "maximum enterpri se value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by \n",
      "infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage, \n",
      "aligning our cost structur e with our revenue growth.  \n",
      "As we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211  billion in \n",
      "revenue and over $88  billion in operating income.  \n",
      "A NEW ERA OF AI  \n",
      "There are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural \n",
      "language. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive human -\n",
      "computer interfac es—keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward —\n",
      "natural language —and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around \n",
      "us.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things \n",
      "and organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over \n",
      "it. This gen eration of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways —from completing or summarizing text, to detecting \n",
      "anomalies and recognizing images —to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.  \n",
      "Together, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our \n",
      "vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and \n",
      "allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or \n",
      "use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to s hop, \n",
      "to code, to analyze, to  learn, to create.\n"

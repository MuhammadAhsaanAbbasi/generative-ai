# RAG ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

Welcome to the **RAG ADVANCED TECHNIQUES** section! This folder contains code samples, exercises, and resources designed to help you get started & getting knowledge of ADVanced Techniques of RAGs using *Pinecone* & *ChromaDB* for building applications that interact with language models like *GPT-4*, *GPT-4o*, *llama* & others *Open-Source* Models.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**RAG** is a two-step dance: *retrieve* fresh, domain-specific facts at the moment of a question, then *generate* a natural-language answer that weaves those facts together.  Instead of forcing a model to “remember” everything during training, we feed it exactly what it needs, exactly when it needs it.

## Core Components

### 1. External Knowledge Sources

Web pages, PDFs, policy docs, code bases, video transcripts—anything you can turn into text is fair game.  These sources live **outside** the model and can be updated independently.

### 2. Chunking

Large documents are sliced into small, overlapping passages (typically 300-1 000 tokens).  This keeps each piece topically focused and cheap to search.

### 3. Embeddings

Every chunk is converted into a numerical vector that captures semantic meaning.  Similar ideas land near one another in this high-dimensional space.

### 4. Vector Store

A purpose-built database (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, etc.) stores those vectors and supports lightning-fast similarity search, plus metadata filters and access controls.

### 5. Similarity Retrieval

When a user asks a question, their query is embedded too.  The system pulls the *k* most similar chunks—often refined with hybrid keyword + semantic search to boost precision.

### 6. Prompt Assembly

Retrieved chunks are “stapled” onto the user’s question, along with system instructions like *“Cite all sources and answer only from provided context.”*

### 7. Generation

The language model now drafts its reply, grounding every claim in the supplied passages.  Many implementations surface inline citations so users can audit each fact.

## Illustrated Walkthrough

* **High-Level Diagram (see first image):** shows the circular loop—question → embedding → retrieve context → LLM → answer.  
* **Detailed Pipeline (see second image):** highlights the data pipeline (collection, preprocessing, embedding), the retrieval step (vector DB search), and the generation step where prompt + context flow into the LLM.  
* **Multimodal Variant (see third image):** demonstrates that text and images can each have their own vector index, allowing RAG to ground answers in mixed media.  
* **Optimisation Diagram (see fourth image):** visualises nearest-neighbour retrieval and prompt construction, reminding us that retrieval quality directly controls answer quality.

## Benefits at a Glance

* **Up-to-date:** swap new documents in and outdated ones out—no retraining cycles.  
* **Explainable:** cite passages so humans (or auditors) can verify every statement.  
* **Efficient:** only the relevant slices consume context-window space and tokens.  
* **Secure:** sensitive docs stay in your controlled database; the model sees them only transiently.

---

## Limitations to Manage

* **Extra hop:** retrieval adds latency; cache frequent queries where possible.  
* **System complexity:** you now maintain embeddings, indexes, and ACL layers.  
* **Garbage-in, garbage-out:** poor chunking or irrelevant sources still yield weak answers—invest in retrieval quality first.

## Real-World Use Cases

* **Enterprise knowledge bots** answering HR or compliance questions with citations.  
* **Customer-support assistants** pulling from FAQs, tickets, and manuals.  
* **Research copilots** summarising scientific papers on demand.  
* **Legal or policy checkers** quoting exact clauses to back up every recommendation.

## Best-Practice Pointers

1. **Tune chunk size and overlap** to preserve context without ballooning storage.  
2. **Adopt hybrid retrieval** (keyword + vector) and re-ranking for higher recall and precision.  
3. **Reserve token budget** keep context ≤ 70 % of the model’s window so it has room to reason.  
4. **Show citations by default;** grounding slashes hallucination rates and boosts trust.  
5. **Monitor drift:** as docs evolve, re-embed and re-evaluate; retrieval quality can quietly decay over time.

Master these pieces and you have a robust recipe for building assistants that are both **knowledge-rich and verifiably accurate**—no model retraining required.

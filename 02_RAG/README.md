# RAG ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

Welcome to the **RAG ADVANCED TECHNIQUES** section! This folder contains code samples, exercises, and resources designed to help you get started & getting knowledge of ADVanced Techniques of RAGs using *Pinecone* & *ChromaDB* for building applications that interact with language models like *GPT-4*, *GPT-4o*, *llama* & others *Open-Source* Models.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**RAG** is a two-step dance: *retrieve* fresh, domain-specific facts at the moment of a question, then *generate* a natural-language answer that weaves those facts together.  Instead of forcing a model to “remember” everything during training, we feed it exactly what it needs, exactly when it needs it.

## Core Components

### 1 · External Knowledge Sources

High-quality RAG begins with **fresh, authoritative material that lives outside the model’s weights**—product manuals in PDF, wiki pages, SQL rows, call-centre transcripts, code snippets, video subtitles, even CSV sensor logs. These sources either post-date the model’s training cut-off or contain proprietary knowledge the public web never held, so they set the ceiling on every downstream metric.

To maximise value:

- **Curate wisely:** balance the breadth of user forums with the cleanliness of edited guides.  
- **Pre-clean:** strip boilerplates, ads, and footers to boost retrieval precision (at an ETL cost).  
- **Segment by sensitivity:** isolate PII-heavy files in a separately guarded index.

---

### 2 · Chunking

Entire documents overflow an LLM context window, so we *slice* them into **semantically coherent segments**. The sweet spot—roughly **300 – 1 000 tokens with 10–20 % overlap**—leaves room for metadata and the answer while preserving context for pronouns, formulas, or code blocks.

Key practices:

- Use recursive splitters (section → paragraph → sentence) to keep logical flow.  
- Chunk code by function or class, not arbitrary lines.  
- Manually spot-check; splitting mid-table or mid-equation destroys meaning and poisons retrieval.

---

### 3 · Embeddings

Each chunk is transformed into a **dense vector in ℝⁿ** so that geometric distance reflects semantic similarity. Commercial APIs such as `text-embedding-3` deliver multilingual quality at a per-token fee; open-source families like **BERT** or **GPT** offer local control but demand GPU/CPU servers.

Watch these levers:

- **Dimensionality** drives RAM footprint and index size.  
- **Domain tuning** (e.g., oncology jargon) can lift recall but needs data + compute.  
- **Throughput & latency** govern real-time user experience.

---

### 4 · Vector Store

A vector is only useful if you can **retrieve neighbours in milliseconds**. Engines like **Pinecone**, **Chroma**, **Weaviate**, **Qdrant**, or **Milvus** build specialised indexes—HNSW for RAM speed, IVF-PQ for disk scale—and attach JSON metadata (source URL, page, language, security tag).

Operational must-haves:

- **Boolean / ACL filters** from metadata to enforce data residency or role-based access.  
- **Replication & backups** when answers influence compliance or legal workflows.

---

### 5 · Similarity Retrieval

At query time, the user’s question is embedded and matched against the store. **Hybrid search**—dense vectors **plus** BM25 keywords—captures both synonyms and exact terms, then a cross-encoder re-ranks the top candidates for razor-sharp precision.

Tuning knobs:

- `k` (how many chunks) and similarity threshold.  
- Diversification (MMR, RRF) to avoid near-duplicate passages.  
- Language, date, or security filters for contextual relevance.

---

### 6 · Prompt Assembly

Retrieved passages, the user question, and a system instruction are woven into a single prompt. Delimiters such as `---SOURCE 1---` help the model cite cleanly, while reserving **25–30 % of the context window** for the answer prevents truncation.

Guardrails that matter:

- *“Answer **only** from the provided context and cite sources in \[brackets\].”*  
- Consistent formatting so automated post-processing (e.g., HTML rendering) stays simple.

---

### 7 · Generation

The LLM now drafts the response, grounding each claim in the supplied evidence. For analytical tasks, prepend a chain-of-thought cue—*“Let’s reason step by step.”* Production stacks often add a **critic loop**: a second model verifies every statement appears in context, flagging hallucinations.

Fine-tuning output:

- **Temperature 0.1 – 0.3** for deterministic, citation-heavy prose; higher for creative summaries.  
- Emit plain text, Markdown, or structured JSON depending on downstream consumers.

---

## Benefits of RAG:

- **Efficiency:** Instead of passing an entire document to the model, RAG retrieves only the most relevant chunks, reducing the computational load.
- **Accuracy:** By using real-time data retrieval, the model can generate more accurate and context-aware answers.
- **Scalability:**: RAG can scale to handle large volumes of text, as it uses chunking and efficient retrieval techniques to access specific parts of the document.

---

## Limitations to Manage

* **Extra hop:** retrieval adds latency; cache frequent queries where possible.  
* **System complexity:** you now maintain embeddings, indexes, and ACL layers.  
* **Garbage-in, garbage-out:** poor chunking or irrelevant sources still yield weak answers—invest in retrieval quality first.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* **Enterprise knowledge bots** answering HR or compliance questions with citations.  
* **Customer-support assistants** pulling from FAQs, tickets, and manuals.  
* **Research copilots** summarising scientific papers on demand.  
* **Legal or policy checkers** quoting exact clauses to back up every recommendation.

## Best-Practice Pointers

1. **Tune chunk size and overlap** to preserve context without ballooning storage.  
2. **Adopt hybrid retrieval** (keyword + vector) and re-ranking for higher recall and precision.  
3. **Reserve token budget** keep context ≤ 70 % of the model’s window so it has room to reason.  
4. **Show citations by default;** grounding slashes hallucination rates and boosts trust.  
5. **Monitor drift:** as docs evolve, re-embed and re-evaluate; retrieval quality can quietly decay over time.

Master these pieces and you have a robust recipe for building assistants that are both **knowledge-rich and verifiably accurate**—no model retraining required.

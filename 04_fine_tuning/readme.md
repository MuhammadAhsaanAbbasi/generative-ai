# Fine Tuning of the LLM (Large Language Model)

Fine-tuning is the most hands-on way to customise a large-language model (LLM). Instead of *telling* the model what to do (prompt engineering) or *showing* it extra documents at run-time (RAG), you **teach the model new habits by updating its weights with your own data**. After training, the behaviour is “baked in” and shows up even when the prompt is short or generic.

## 1. What exactly gets changed?

Every transformer layer contains millions of parameters that decide which token comes next. Fine-tuning runs additional training passes so those parameters shift toward your new dataset. The result is a *new* model checkpoint that:

* Speaks in your brand’s tone
* Knows specialised vocabulary or workflows
* Follows stricter formatting rules
* Performs niche tasks (e.g. medical coding, legal clause extraction)

## 2. Three common flavours

| Method                    | What you update                                | Typical use-case                                       | GPU cost |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Full fine-tune**        | *All* parameters                               | Small/medium model you can fully own; maximum accuracy | Highest  |
| **PEFT / LoRA / AdaLora** | Tiny adapter matrices injected into each layer | Keep a huge base model frozen but add your twist       | Moderate |
| **Instruction fine-tune** | A few final layers + supervised RL alignment   | Make replies polite, safe, or JSON-formatted           | Moderate |

> **Tip:** For most enterprise chatbots, a LoRA adapter (tens of millions of parameters) strikes the best balance between cost and control.

## 3. Data you need

| Data type                                 | How many examples? | Quality hint                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction–response pairs**            | 1 k – 100 k+       | Think “question → ideal answer.”                              |
| **Conversation transcripts**              | Hours of logs      | Clean out user PII & off-topic chatter.                       |
| **Domain documents (for language style)** | 10 MB – 1 GB       | Convert to Q-A or “summarise this” tasks so the model learns. |

*Rule of thumb*: 5 k high-quality pairs beat 50 k sloppy ones.

## 4. Training pipeline in five steps

1. **Prep & label** – normalise text, remove sensitive info, create prompt-response pairs.
2. **Split** – 80 % train, 10 % validation, 10 % test.
3. **Choose a base** – e.g. Llama-3-8B if you need open-source, GPT-3.5 Turbo if using OpenAI’s fine-tune API.
4. **Train / monitor** – watch loss curves; early-stop when validation loss plateaus.
5. **Evaluate & guard-rail** – run domain test cases, bias/safety checks, hallucination audits.

## 5. Deployment & ops considerations

| Concern               | Mitigation                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model size**        | Quantise to INT8 or INT4 for edge devices.                               |
| **Version sprawl**    | Store checkpoints in a registry; use clear semantic versioning.          |
| **Regeneration cost** | Cache frequent responses or embed the model behind an inference gateway. |
| **Safety drift**      | Schedule periodic red-team prompts and retrain if drift detected.        |

## 6. Strengths at a glance

* **Consistent personality & format**—no need to repeat long style prompts.
* **Offline capability**—run the model on a secure internal server with no RAG dependency.
* **Task accuracy**—especially for classification, structured extraction, or code generation.

## 7. Key trade-offs

* **Up-front spend**—GPUs + data labelling + ML-Ops pipeline.
* **Maintenance**—new facts require another training round (or a hybrid RAG layer).
* **Risk of overfit**—too little data → model parrots training set and loses general reasoning.

## 8. When fine-tuning is your best move

| Scenario                                                          | Why fine-tune beats prompts/RAG                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Every message must reflect strict brand tone**                  | A single short prompt can drift; fine-tuning hard-codes tone.             |
| **Edge / air-gapped deployment**                                  | No external DB calls allowed; all knowledge must live inside the weights. |
| **High-volume structured tasks** (e.g. invoice coding)            | Deterministic output with low latency.                                    |
| **Complex transformations** (code refactor, diagnostic reasoning) | Extra domain examples push accuracy beyond prompt tricks.                 |

If you only need *fresh* factual knowledge, bolt on **RAG** instead. If you just need a quick prototype, start with **prompt engineering**. But when tone, task, and offline independence all matter, fine-tuning is the heavyweight champion.

## 9. Quick cheat sheet

| Need                         | Go-to solution     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Up-to-date policies          | RAG                |
| Prototype in one afternoon   | Prompt engineering |
| Locked-in behaviour at scale | **Fine-tuning**    |

## 10. Take-home

Fine-tuning is like giving “Jarvis” a full semester of private tutoring: once the lessons stick, it answers in your voice, with your expertise, every single time—no extra hints needed. It costs more than clever prompting or a RAG backpack, but when you *must* own both the brain and the voice of your AI, fine-tuning is the surest path.
